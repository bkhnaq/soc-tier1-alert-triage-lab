# soc-tier1-alert-triage-lab
Hands-on SOC Tier 1 alert triage lab using Wazuh SIEM/EDR: brute force, PowerShell alerts, triage workflow, playbooks, and escalation.

This lab uses a Wazuh All-in-One deployment where the Manager, Indexer, and Dashboard are hosted on a single Ubuntu Server. Although physically co-located, the architecture 
is logically separated to reflect a production SOC design, allowing independent scaling of detection, storage, and visualization components in real-world environments.
